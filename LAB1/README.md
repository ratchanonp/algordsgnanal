# LAB 1 | Find GCD 

In this lab we use 3 difference algorithm to find gcd 
1. Find gcd by using prime factorization that used naive algorithm
2. Find gcd by using prime factorization but used ```sive of eratosthenes```
3. Find gcd by using recursive function

## Prime Factorization 
### Naive Algorithm

### Sieve Of Eratosthenes Algorithm

## Euclidean Algorithm
